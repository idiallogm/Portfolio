      <h1 class="border-top">About Me</h1>
      <p>My passion for web development was derived from another love of mine: cars. Growing up I was a four-sport athlete, but my athletic run was cut short due to injuries that never healed properly.</p>
        
       <p>  So to cope, I put my interest in cars. I would attend car meets and binge watch videos of ridiculous rides on YouTube. Once I reached the age of 19, I went and applied for the Automotive Tech. position at Mercedes-Benz. Not long after i was called in for an interview. This was the day I became interested in the world of coding. The interviewer asked me what were my future plans with the company, and I answered stating that I look forward to becoming the inventor of my own supercharged petrol engine. I could see in his face he noticed my zeal to attack that goal, but he stopped my in my tracks and informed me about how the automotive industry was making their shift to Electric Vehicles.</p>
      <p>For a moment, I thought to myself "well thank you, for wrecking my dreams". However, after I left the interview, I went home and conducted some research on the subject. That's when i learned the role of coding in the development of such vehicles. I had already considered being and IT major in college, but the fact that I could merge the two factors, my love of cars and coding, I decided that it would be the best route for me to set up on, and finding out that coding was one of the highest-paid professions was like the cherry on top. From that day, forward I enlisted to become from the Full-stack Developers of the world and become well versed in majority of the programming languages.</p>
